Description: Internet Protocol Service Daemons
 ipsvd is a set of internet protocol service daemons. It currently includes
 a TCP/IP service daemon, and a UDP/IP service daemon.
 .
 An internet protocol service (ipsv) daemon waits for incoming connections
 on a local socket.  On incoming connections, the ipsv daemon conditionally
 runs an arbitrary program with standard input reading from the socket, and
 standard output writing to the socket, that handles the connection.
 Standard error is used for logging.
