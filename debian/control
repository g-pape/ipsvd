Description: Internet protocol service daemons
 ipsvd is a set of ``internet protocol service daemons'' for Unix.  It
 includes daemons for TCP/IP and UDP/IP.  An Internet protocol service
 (ipsv) daemon waits for incoming connections on a socket, and for new
 connections, it conditionally runs an arbitrary program to handle the
 connection.  ipsv daemons can be told to read and follow pre-defined
 instructions on how to handle incoming connections.  Based on the
 client's IP address or hostname, it's possible to run different
 programs, set a different environment, deny a connection, or set a per
 host concurrency limit.
 .
 ipsvd can be used to run services usually run by inetd, xinetd, or
 tcpserver.  Normally the ipsv daemons are run by a supervisor process,
 such as runsv from the runit package, or supervise from the daemontools
 package.  ipsvd uses the djbdns client library to query the DNS.
