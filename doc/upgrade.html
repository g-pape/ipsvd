<h1>ipsvd - upgrading from previous versions</h1>
<hr>
<h3>0.7.0 or 0.7.1 to 8.0.0</h3>
No further action from you is required.
<h3>0.6.1 to 0.7.0 or 0.7.1</h3>
A new type of instruction has been added.
<i>ipsvd</i> now can be told to look up IP addresses of (dynamic)
hostnames on incoming connections, and to handle a connection through
different instructions if the client's IP address matches one of these
addresses.
See <a href="ipsvd-instruct.5.html">ipsvd-instruct</a> for details.
The <a href="examples.html">examples web page</a> has been updated
slightly, and additionally includes an example of the new check host
instructions.
