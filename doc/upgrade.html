<h1>ipsvd - upgrading from previous versions</h1>
<hr>
<h3>0.8.0 or 0.8.2 to 0.9.1</h3>
This version introduces the new <a href="sslio.8.html">sslio</a> program
(for Linux only), which can be used to encrypt network connections using
SSLv3.
A new web page describing some of <i>ipsvd</i>'s
<a href="benefits.html">benefits</a> has been added to the documentation.
<h3>0.7.0 or 0.7.1 to 0.8.0 or 0.8.2</h3>
No further action from you is required.
<h3>0.6.1 to 0.7.0 or 0.7.1</h3>
A new type of instruction has been added.
<i>ipsvd</i> now can be told to look up IP addresses of (dynamic)
hostnames on incoming connections, and to handle a connection through
different instructions if the client's IP address matches one of these
addresses.
See <a href="ipsvd-instruct.5.html">ipsvd-instruct</a> for details.
The <a href="examples.html">examples</a> have been updated slightly,
and additionally includes an example of the new check host instructions.
