<h1>ipsvd - upgrading from previous versions</h1>
<hr>
<h3>0.10.1 to 0.11.0</h3>
The <a href="sslio.8.html">sslio</a> program also runs on MacOSX, see the
<a href="install.html">installation insructions</a> on how to enable it in
the build and testing process.
<h3>0.9.x to 0.10.1</h3>
Client support has been added to the <a href="sslio.8.html">sslio</a>
program to have it run under <tt>tcpclient</tt>.
The logging, especially for ssl warnings and errors, has been improved, and
the documentation updated.
<p>
Here's a sample on how to use <a href="sslio.8.html">sslio</a> in client
mode with <tt>tcpclient</tt>, a <tt>https@</tt> program derived from
ucspi-tcp's <tt>http@</tt> program:
<pre>
 #!/bin/sh
 echo "GET /${2-} HTTP/1.0
 Host: ${1-0}:${3-443}
 " | tcpclient -RHl0 -- "${1-0}" "${3-443}" sslio -c sh -c '
   addcr >&7
   exec delcr <&6
 ' | awk '/^$/ { body=1; next } { if (body) print }'
</pre>
<h3>0.8.0 or 0.8.2 to 0.9.x</h3>
This version introduces the new <a href="sslio.8.html">sslio</a> program
(for Linux only), which can be used to encrypt network connections using
SSLv3.
A new web page describing some of <i>ipsvd</i>'s
<a href="benefits.html">benefits</a> has been added to the documentation.
<h3>0.7.0 or 0.7.1 to 0.8.0 or 0.8.2</h3>
No further action from you is required.
<h3>0.6.1 to 0.7.0 or 0.7.1</h3>
A new type of instruction has been added.
<i>ipsvd</i> now can be told to look up IP addresses of (dynamic)
hostnames on incoming connections, and to handle a connection through
different instructions if the client's IP address matches one of these
addresses.
See <a href="ipsvd-instruct.5.html">ipsvd-instruct</a> for details.
The <a href="examples.html">examples</a> have been updated slightly,
and additionally includes an example of the new check host instructions.
